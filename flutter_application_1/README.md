# flutter_application_1

A new Flutter project. I will be using Visual Studio Code for flutter development. 

Few points to remember are

1) Enable Flutter and Dart extentions in VS Code
2) Make sure your device is connected to VS Code
3) Make sure you can see your flutter version and mobile name in VS Code before coding
